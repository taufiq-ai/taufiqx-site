2. Make each tabs visible by slug not .html

3. remove imgs from project, publications

5. at the end of each blog add recent, previous-next, 

7. make easy maintanable
8. add talk tab
9. projects, publications, talk reuse same html/css 
10. Index page can be the about page directly

Most of simple templates are messy in long run

I want simple but easy scroll, separate component, easy maintanance

RESEARCH - html/css site can render html for blog 


1. Remove Vendor
4. blog can use img, use grid, filter, 
6. No heavy js and css would be fine
